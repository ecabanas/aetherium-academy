## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 70%, 50% (equivalent to RGB hex #3D99FF), a vibrant blue evoking knowledge and clarity, suitable for a learning environment.
- Background color: HSL 210, 20%, 95% (equivalent to RGB hex #F0F5FF), a very light desaturated blue, for a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that maintains a connection with the primary color.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 65%, 40% (equivalent to RGB hex #29A9A9), a teal tone, provides a contrasting hue for interactive elements, ensuring visibility without overwhelming the user.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), for headlines and shorter text passages, for its modern, scientific feel
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif), a grotesque-style sans-serif to support large blocks of text.
- Employ clear, minimalist icons to represent learning paths, topics, and actions (e.g., flashcard creation, progress tracking).
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations for a fluid user experience. For instance, animate the appearance of new chatbot messages, flashcard flips, and chart updates.
